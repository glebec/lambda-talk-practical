 *
 * Mogensen-Scott encodings let us define Algebraic Data Types in terms of
 * _collections of functions_. Each function represents one of the allowed
 * branches of data in the collection. Each function shares the same API.
 *
 * To tell which piece of data you are dealing with, or to convert your data
 * to some other form, you pass in function arguments to handle _each different
 * case_ that you might have on hand. In other words, Scott encodings are a lot
 * like a switch case â€“ or more rather, a form of pattern matching!
